# Decisions

Record of choices made where the Phase 1 spec was ambiguous or left an
implementation detail open. Newest first.

## 2026-09-27 — Next.js version

Scaffolded with whatever `create-next-app@latest` resolved to (Next
16.3.6 at bootstrap time) rather than pinning to an older LTS. Reason:
spec says "modern Next.js App Router"; no requirement to pin. Risk:
less training-data familiarity with 16-specific API changes — mitigated
by checking `node_modules/next/dist/docs` for the exact installed
version instead of relying on memory, and preferring well-established
App Router patterns (server components, route handlers, server
actions) that have been stable across 14/15/16.

## 2026-09-27 — shadcn `<Form>` wrapper unavailable

The current shadcn CLI (Radix base, Nova preset) does not ship a
`form.tsx` registry item for the Radix base library. Forms are built
directly with `react-hook-form` + `@hookform/resolvers/zod`, using the
plain `Label`/`Input`/etc. primitives, instead of the classic shadcn
`<Form>`/`<FormField>` wrapper. No product behavior is affected; this
is purely a component-composition detail.

## 2026-09-27 — Package name

npm rejects capitalized/space-containing package names, and the
working directory is `Form Builder Saas claude`. The Next.js app is
scaffolded with `package.json` name `formcraft` (also used as the
working product name in docs/UI) while the directory itself is left
unchanged. No functional impact — the directory name is never read by
the app.
